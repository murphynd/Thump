## Additional Information

I want to try my hand at creating a music-making product, I had so much fun during team week but I was mainly working on the C# side of the project and building out the framework. I did lots of research on the topic and I feel like this would be a great project to dive in and actually write some music-making tools myself. My main goals are to focus on making this a mobile-friendly app and to fully deploy it. I want to have user authentication and have the ability to save. this to be a real site that users can share with their friends on their phones.

Really excited to make some noise with THumP
